Hi there 👋, My Name is Arnold and welcome to my GitHub profile page. 

I am a Graduate with a Bachelor of Information Sciences. I have a Major in Software Engineering and a Minor in Games Programming. 

I studied at Massey University from 2020-2022 & had my ceremony in May 2023.

## About Me 
- 🌱 I'm currently in the process of creating a Unity game based on Space Invaders with a colleague

- ⚡ My hobbies include coding, driving, motorbike riding, hiking, travelling, playing chess, making games & PC building.

- 🔭 In the time that I do get free I enjoy learning new skills and programming languages

- 🚀 I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities.

I am interested in trying new things and gaining new knowledge. I want to get into front-end or back-end programming. I also have a deep passion for game programming.

Just so you know, I am in the process of uploading past projects and making them look presentable for Github. As well I have a few projects in development which are yet to come. Please stay tuned for more.

In these last few months, I have been setting up my GitHub profile, which will explain why there are not many active commits. Also, many of my projects have been made private and now I am in the process of making them public and updating them to 
suit GitHub for display to all. 

Thank you for visiting my Profile page. :)

I also use plastic SCM for Unity Commits as well.

## Current Projects In The Works (Updated Feb 2024)
- Developing First-person shooter in Unity, currently self-learning Unreal Engine on the side and converting my Unity Project to that.
- 2D Space Invaders Game conversion from Java to Unity Engine, might also make this into Unreal Engine.
- Ongoing Website changes from time to time.
- React Development Projects
